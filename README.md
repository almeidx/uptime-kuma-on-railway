## Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with Uptime Kuma or Railway in any way, I just wanted to make this for myself and thought I'd share it with others. The "Deploy on Railway" contains a referral code, which gives me a small amount of credit if you use it. If you don't want to use it, you can remove it from the URL.
